## What is Loopstack?

Loopstack simplifies AI workflow automation by providing a declarative YAML-based approach to define complex AI operations. Instead of writing boilerplate code for AI integrations, prompt management, and workflow orchestration, you define your logic in configuration files and let Loopstack handle the execution.

It ships with a built-in frontend to execute and control your workflows while providing a well documented API and developer SDK for integration in your own applications.

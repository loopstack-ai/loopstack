# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Quick Guide

### Adding a Changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Version Types

- **patch**: Bug fixes and minor changes (0.0.X)
- **minor**: New features, backwards compatible (0.X.0)
- **major**: Breaking changes (X.0.0)

### Prereleases

For prerelease versions, use the GitHub Actions workflow "Prerelease" with the desired type (alpha/beta/rc).

### Snapshots

For testing changes from any branch without committing, use the "Snapshot Release" workflow.
